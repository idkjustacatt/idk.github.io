# LiftiumChk 
Howdy, I decided to update this checker because it had been eating shit for a while and was working shoddily. 


It currently supports Stripe and the Square API (U dont need any sk).

[free version, dont use this shit..](https://github.com/Blagdoii/LiftiumChk/blob/main/chk.py)


> installation
`you don't need to install anything, the script is portable`
